## About the OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide

The OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG) is a comprehensive manual for testing the security of mobile apps. It describes processes and techniques for verifying the requirements listed in the [Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS)](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs "MASVS"), and provides a baseline for complete and consistent security tests.

OWASP thanks the many authors, reviewers, and editors for their hard work in developing this guide. If you have any comments or suggestions on the Mobile Security Testing Guide, please join the discussion around MASVS and MSTG in the [OWASP Mobile Security Project Slack Channel](https://owasp.slack.com/messages/project-mobile_omtg/details/ "OWASP Mobile Security Project Slack Channel"). You can sign up for the Slack channel yourself using [this URL](https://owasp.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-g398htpy-AZ40HOM1WUOZguJKbblqkw#// "Slack channel sign up"). (Please open a Pull Request in our Github Repo if the invite has expired.)

## Disclaimer

Please consult the laws in your country before executing any tests against mobile apps by utilizing the MSTG materials. Refrain from violating the laws with anything described in the MSTG.

### Donators

While both the MASVS and the MSTG are created and maintained by the community on a voluntary basis, sometimes a little bit of outside help is required. We therefore thank our donators for providing the funds to be able to hire technical editors. Note that their donation does not influence the content of the MASVS or MSTG in any way. The Donation Packages are described on the [OWASP Project Wiki](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Mobile_Security_Testing_Guide#tab=Sponsorship_Packages "OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide Donation Packages").
