Welcome to the UnCrackable Apps for Android and iOS, a collection of mobile reverse engineering challenges. These challenges are used as examples throughout the Mobile Security Testing Guide. Of course, you can also solve them for fun.

### [UnCrackable App for Android Level 3](Android/Level_03 "Android level 3")

The crackme from hell!

- Objective: A secret string is hidden somewhere in this app. Find a way to extract it.
- Author: [Bernhard Mueller](https://github.com/b-mueller "Bernhard Mueller").
- Special thanks to Eduardo Novella for testing, feedback and pointing out flaws in the initial build(s).
- Maintained by the OWASP MSTG leaders.

#### Installation

This app is compatible with Android 4.4 and up.

```shell
$ adb install UnCrackable-Level3.apk
```

### [UnCrackable App for Android Level 4: Radare2 Pay v0.9](Android/Level_04 "Android level 4")

The Radare2 community always dreamed with its decentralized and free currency to allow r2 fans to make payments in places and transfer money between r2 users. A debug version has been developed and it will be supported very soon in many stores and websites. Can you verify that this is cryptographically unbreakable?

Hint: Run the APK in a non-tampered device to play a bit with the app.

- Objectives:
  - 1: There is a master PIN code that generates green tokens (aka r2coins) on the screen. If you see a red r2coin, then this token won't be validated by the community. You need to find out the 4 digits PIN code and the salt employed as well. Flag: `r2con{PIN_NUMERIC:SALT_LOWERCASE}`
  - 2: There is a "r2pay master key" buried in layers of obfuscation and protections. Can you break the whitebox? Flag: `r2con{ascii(key)}`
- Author: [Eduardo Novella](https://github.com/enovella "Eduardo Novella") & [Gautam Arvind](https://github.com/darvincisec "Gautam Arvind").
- Special thanks to [NowSecure](https://www.nowsecure.com "NowSecure") for supporting this crackme.
- Maintained by [Eduardo Novella](https://github.com/enovella "Eduardo Novella") & [Gautam Arvind](https://github.com/darvincisec "Gautam Arvind").

#### Installation

This app is compatible with Android 4.4 and up.

```shell
$ adb install r2pay-v0.9.apk
```

#### Versions
- `v0.9` - Release for `OWASP MSTG`.
  - Source code is available and the compilation has been softened in many ways to make the challenge easier and more enjoyable for newcomers.
- `v1.0` - Release for `R2con CTF 2020`.
  - No source code is available and many extra protections are in place.

#### Solutions R2pay v0.9
- Not yet

#### Solutions R2pay v1.0

### [Android License Validator](Android/License_01 "Android License Validator")

A brand new Android app sparks your interest. Of course, you are planning to purchase a license for the app eventually, but you'd still appreciate a test run before shelling out $1. Unfortunately no keygen is available!

- Objective: Generate a valid serial key that is accepted by this app.
- Author: [Bernhard Mueller](https://github.com/b-mueller "Bernhard Mueller").
- Maintained by the OWASP MSTG leaders.

#### Installation

Copy the binary to your Android device and run using the shell.

```shell
  $ adb push validate /data/local/tmp
  [100%] /data/local/tmp/validate
  $ adb shell chmod 755 /data/local/tmp/validate
  $ adb shell /data/local/tmp/validate
  Usage: ./validate <serial>
  $ adb shell /data/local/tmp/validate 1234
  Incorrect serial (wrong format).
```

## iOS

### [UnCrackable App for iOS Level 1](iOS/Level_01 "iOS level 1")

This app holds a secret inside. Can you find it?

- Objective: A secret string is hidden somewhere in this binary. Find a way to extract it. The app will give you a hint when started.
- Author: [Bernhard Mueller](https://github.com/b-mueller "Bernhard Mueller")
- Maintained by the OWASP MSTG leaders.

#### Installation

Open the "Device" window in Xcode and drag the IPA file into the list below "Installed Apps".

Note: The IPA is signed with an Enterprise distribution certificate. You'll need to install the provisioning profile and trust the developer to run the app the "normal" way. Alternatively, re-sign the app with your own certificate, or run it on a jailbroken device (you'll want to do one of those anyway to crack it).

### [UnCrackable App for iOS Level 2](iOS/Level_02 "iOS level 2")

This app holds a secret inside - and this time it won't be tampered with!

- Objective: Find the secret code - it is related to alcoholic beverages.
- Author: [Bernhard Mueller](https://github.com/b-mueller "Bernhard Mueller").
- Maintained by the OWASP MSTG leaders.

Note: Due to its anti-tampering the app won't run correctly if the main executable is modified and/or re-signed. You'll need to trust the developer run it the standard way on a non-jailbroken device (General Settings -> Profile & Device Management) and to verify the solution.

#### Installation

Open the "Device" window in Xcode and drag the IPA file into the list below "Installed Apps".

Note: The IPA is signed with an Enterprise distribution certificate. You'll need to install the provisioning profile and trust the developer to run the app the "normal" way. Alternatively, re-sign the app with your own certificate, or run it on a jailbroken device (you'll want to do one of those anyway to crack it).
